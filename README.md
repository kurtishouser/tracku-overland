# TrackU
TrackU is a React SPA that displays location information from your iPhone provided by the [Overland iOS](https://overland.p3k.io/) app. The app uses Socket.IO to communicate with the [TrackU API](https://github.com/kurtishouser/tracku-api) server and provide constant updates from the iPhone without having to refresh the web page.
